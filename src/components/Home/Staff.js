                            I am proud that I have personally helped hundreds of young people overcome their self-doubt and anxieties to achieve their goals and become safe and confident drivers.

                            I chose to become a Driver Trainer because I am driven to make the roads a safer place for myself, my loved ones, and the students I teach. Having personally experienced road rage from licensed drivers, I believe many drivers unknowingly place others at risk. My mission is to coach and develop respectful road users committed to safe driving for life.

                            Through my role as Secretary for The NSW Driver Trainers Association, I am actively advocating for greater road safety and working towards reducing fatalities on NSW roads.
